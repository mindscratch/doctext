Comprehensive ESRD Care (CEC) Model Telehealth Implementation

PROVIDER TYPES AFFECTED
This MLN Matters Article is intended for physicians, providers, and suppliers billing Medicare
Administrative Contractors (MACs) and participating in the Comprehensive ESRD Care (CEC)
Model for telehealth services provided to Medicare End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
beneficiaries associated with the CEC Model.

PROVIDER ACTION NEEDED
Change Request (CR) 10314 details the CEC Model telehealth program and how it will be
implemented. Make sure your billing staffs are aware of this initiative.

BACKGROUND
Section 1115A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) (added by Section 3021 of the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) (42 USC 1315a) authorizes the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation
(CMMI) to test innovate health care payment and service-delivery models that have the potential
to lower Medicare, Medicaid, and the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP) spending while
maintaining or improving the quality of beneficiaries’ care.
The CEC Model is designed to identify, test, and evaluate new ways to improve care for
Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD. Through the CEC Model, the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) will partner with health care providers and suppliers to test the
effectiveness of a new payment and service delivery model in providing beneficiaries with
person-centered, high-quality care. The Model builds on Accountable Care Organization (ACO)
experience from the Pioneer ACO Model, Next Generation ACO Model, and the Medicare
Shared Savings Program to test Accountable Care Organizations for ESRD beneficiaries.
More than 600,000 Americans have ESRD and require life-sustaining dialysis treatments
several times per week. Many beneficiaries with ESRD suffer from poorer health outcomes,

often the result of underlying disease complications and multiple co-morbidities. These can lead
to high rates of hospital admission and readmissions, as well as a mortality rate that is higher
than that of the general Medicare population.
According to United States Renal Data System, in 2014, ESRD beneficiaries comprised less
than 1 percent of the Medicare population, but accounted for an estimated 7.2 percent of total
Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) spending, totaling more than $32.8 billion.
Because of their complex health needs, beneficiaries often require visits to multiple providers
and follow multiple care plans, all of which can be challenging for beneficiaries if care is not
coordinated. The CEC Model seeks to create incentives to enhance care coordination and to
create a person-centered, coordinated care experience, and to ultimately improve health
outcomes for this population.
In the CEC Model, dialysis clinics, nephrologists and other providers collaborate to create an
ESRD Seamless Care Organization (ESCO) to coordinate care for matched beneficiaries.
ESCOs are accountable for clinical quality outcomes and financial outcomes measured by
Medicare Part A and B spending, including all spending on dialysis services for their aligned
ESRD beneficiaries. This model encourages dialysis providers to think beyond their traditional
roles in care delivery and supports them as they provide patient-centered care that will address
beneficiaries’ health needs, both in and outside of the dialysis clinic.
The CEC Model includes separate financial arrangements for larger and smaller dialysis
organizations. Large Dialysis Organizations (LDOs), defined as having 200 or more dialysis
facilities, will be eligible to receive shared savings payments. These LDOs will also be liable for
shared losses and will have higher overall levels of risk compared with their smaller
counterparts.
Non-Large Dialysis Organizations (Non-LDOs) include chains with fewer than 200 dialysis
facilities, independent dialysis facilities, and hospital-based dialysis facilities. Non-LDOs will
have the option of participating in a one-sided track where they will be able to receive shared
savings payments, but will not be liable for payment of shared losses, or participating in a track
with higher risk and the potential for shared losses. The one-sided track is offered in recognition
of the Non-LDOs more limited resources.
The CEC Model began on October 1, 2015, and will run until December 31, 2020. The CEC
Model conducted a solicitation in 2016 to add more ESCOs for Performance Year 2 of the
model, beginning on January 1, 2017. The CEC Model has no current plans for another round of
solicitations.
The CEC Model LDO payment track and Non-LDO two-sided payment track are considered
Advance Payment Models (APMs) regarding the Quality Payment Program.
The CEC Model will implement design elements with implications for the FFS system for its third
performance year that includes benefit enhancements to give ACOs the tools to direct care and
engage beneficiaries in their own care. The model also offers increased monitoring to account
for different financial incentives and the provision of enhanced benefits. The model’s quality

requirements are similar to Shared Savings Program (SSP) and Pioneer, modified as needed to
take into account unique aspects of dialysis care, in keeping with the agencies initiatives to unify
and streamline quality measurement and requirements.
Telehealth Waiver
In order to emphasize high-value services and support the ability of ESCOs to manage the care
of beneficiaries, CMS plans to design policies and use the authority under Section 1115A of the
Social Security Act (Section 3021 of the Affordable Care Act) to conditionally waive certain
Medicare payment requirements as part of the CEC Model.
CMS will make available to qualified ESCOs a waiver of the originating site requirement for
services provided via telehealth. This benefit enhancement will allow beneficiaries to receive
qualified telehealth services in non-rural locations and locations that are not specified by statute,
such as homes and dialysis facilities. The waiver will apply only to eligible aligned beneficiaries
receiving services from ESCO providers.
An aligned beneficiary will be eligible to receive telehealth services through this waiver if the
services are otherwise qualified with respect to:
1) The service provided, as designated by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) or
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, and
2) The remote site.
MACs will apply claims processing edit logic, audit, medical review, Medicare Secondary Payor,
and fraud and abuse activities, appeals and overpayment processes for CEC claims in the
same manner as normal FFS claims.
Notwithstanding these waivers, all telehealth services must be furnished in accordance with all
other Medicare coverage and payment criteria, and no additional reimbursement will be made to
cover set-up costs, technology purchases, training and education, or other related costs. In
particular, the services allowed through telehealth are limited to those described under Section
1834(m)(4)(F) of the Act, and subsequent additional services specified through regulation with
the exception that claims will not be allowed for the following telehealth services rendered to
aligned beneficiaries located at their residence:
•
•
•
•
•
