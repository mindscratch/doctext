# doctext

```
go run main.go $(pwd)/MM10314.pdf > MM10314.txt
```

For the word doc I needed other things installed that I didn't want to try and compile and install (such as `wvWare`),
but you get the gist.

Installed:
* go get github.com/JalfResi/justext
* other things listed here: https://github.com/sajari/docconv#dependencies
